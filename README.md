Simulate and stream temperature sensor data using a real-time pipeline powered by **RabbitMQ**, **PostgreSQL**, and **FastAPI**. This project publishes synthetic temperature data, processes it via RabbitMQ, stores it in a PostgreSQL database, and broadcasts updates to WebSocket-connected clients.

## üì¶ Tech Stack

* üêç **Python**
* üêá **RabbitMQ** ‚Äì message broker for decoupled communication
* üêò **PostgreSQL** ‚Äì relational database for persistent storage
* ‚ö° **FastAPI** ‚Äì web framework with WebSocket support
* üì¨ **Pika** ‚Äì RabbitMQ client library for Python
* üõ¢Ô∏è **psycopg2** ‚Äì PostgreSQL adapter for Python

## üìÅ Project Structure

```
realtime-temp-monitor/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ producer.py       # Sends temperature data to RabbitMQ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ consumer.py        # Listens to RabbitMQ and stores data in PostgreSQL
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py/             # FastAPI app with WebSocket endpoint

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Requirements

Ensure **RabbitMQ** and **PostgreSQL** are running locally.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/realtime-temp-monitor.git
cd temperature-streaming

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up the Database

```bash
python db/db_setup.py
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Temperature Producer

```bash
python producer/producer.py
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Start the WebSocket API Server

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

---

## üîå WebSocket Endpoint

Connect your WebSocket client (Postman, browser, frontend) to:

```
ws://localhost:8000/ws/temperature
```

All connected clients will receive live temperature updates in real-time.

---

## üìä Sample Use Case

* IoT simulation for temperature monitoring
* Real-time dashboards for sensor networks
* Prototyping pub/sub and streaming pipelines

---

## üß† Future Enhancements

* Store timestamps with each reading
* Add Grafana or Streamlit dashboard
* Deploy using Docker or Kubernetes
* Add authentication for WebSocket connections
